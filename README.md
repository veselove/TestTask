# TestTask

### Implement one page application based on RecyclerView with a list of images.
- It may works like HomeScreen 7x10 items (add 2 pt between images) on a
smartphone with horizontal pagination.
- The top bar should contain two buttons: “+” and “Reload All”.
- On “+” button it should add a new image to the end of the list.
- Reload all function should remove all existing images and load 140 new. Images
should be rounded with corner radius = 7.
- Collection should scroll without any lags or freezes and be smooth. Also you need to
appear activity indicator for cell if image not loaded yet.
- You can get new images by executing this request http://loremflickr.com/200/200/ .
Each request will response you with different image.
